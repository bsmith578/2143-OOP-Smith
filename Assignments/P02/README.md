## P02 - MyVector Class 2
### Brett Smith
### Description:

This program takes the class created in P01 and adds more functionality. This is achieved by
adding methods to overload C++ operators (<<, [], +, -, *, /, =, ==). Some of these
methods will allow the program to print a Vector using '<<' without having to call the print
method or add a value onto the vector using '+' instead of having to call a push method.
